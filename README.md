Here are the languages I've been exposed to

python:
print("hello,i am Damon.Nice to meet you!")

java:
System.out.print("hello ,i am Damon .Nice to meet you!");

c++:
std::cout<<"Hello ,I am Damon.Nice to meet you!";

I will try to learn more languages later.I hope I can learn together with like-minded partners.Thanks!
