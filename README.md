Here are the three languages I've learn.
python :
print("Hello,I am Damon.Nice to meet you !")

java:
System.out.print("Hello, I am Damon.Nice to meet you!");

c++:
std::cout<<"Hello , I am Damon .Nice to meet you!";

I will learn more languages.Without double,I hope I can learn together with like-minded partners.Thanks!
